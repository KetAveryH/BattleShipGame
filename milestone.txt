Right now, running hostGame() on a given board will properly prompt the player to place their ships, then allow the player to target the ai's board. 
This will continue running, and the game will accurately tell if targets or positions are invalid, and display the board accurately for every move.
The unimplemented parts include random ai placement, and random ai targeting. Currently, the AI has a board and targets in a line.

Next Steps Include:
 implementing our functions that say when ships are sunk, and that end the game when a player wins
 creating advanced AI, then putting it into the game. After that, it should be fully functional and playable. Right now, we don't necessarily play a full round,
    but almost all funcitons are built and player's entire game experience has been built and polished.
 Final polishing? Extra features? Testing?
