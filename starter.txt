Project: Text-based Game Project (WordHunt AI)

Project Goals: 
We will make a program that acts as an AI assister in the game "Word Hunt".
The program itself will not automatically play the game, however it will
give one of the two players words to input in order to hopefully beat the
other player. This way you can beat that one friend of yours who always
somehow manages to get triple your score.
