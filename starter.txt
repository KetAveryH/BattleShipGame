Project: Text-based Game Project (BattleShip)

Project Goals: 
We will create battleship, our first goal is being able to lay out the ships on the grid
we will then integrate a random generator that places the ships on the other side, then 
we will implement an attacking feature into the game, we will then implement an AI that
randomly attacks points on your side, and if it hits a position it will either hit near
your ship, or randomly on the board.
